# SV-expression_integration
Genomic rearrangements exert a heavy influence on the molecular landscape of cancer. New analytical approaches integrating Structural Variants (SVs) with altered gene features represent a framework by which we can assign global significance to a core set of genes, analogous to established methods that identify genes non-randomly targeted by somatic mutation or copy number alteration. There is need for a systematic identification and cataloging of genes that are recurrently altered transcriptionally in cancer as a result of genomic rearrangement. We have developed a systematic analytical approach to integrate SV breakpoint information with the altered expression of nearby genes, whereby, utilizing public genomic datasets, we have cataloged hundreds of genes appearing deregulated by rearrangement-mediated cis-regulatory alterations.
